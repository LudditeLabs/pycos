Description: pycos is a Python framework for concurrent, asynchronous,
        distributed, communicating tasks. Programs developed with pycos have
        same logic and structure as Python programs with threads, except for a
        few syntactic changes. pycos supports socket I/O notification
        mechanisms epoll, kqueue, /dev/poll (and poll and select, where
        necessary), and Windows I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) for high
        performance and scalability, and SSL for security. pycos has been
        tested with Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. pycos is implemented with
        standard modules in Python.
